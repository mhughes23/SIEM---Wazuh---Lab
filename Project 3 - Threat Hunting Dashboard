# Project 3: Threat Hunting Dashboard & Reporting with Wazuh

## Overview
In this project, I built custom threat hunting dashboards in Wazuh and Kibana to visualize suspicious activity and create analyst-style reports. 
The goal was to simulate how a SOC analyst would proactively search for threats, correlate alerts, and communicate findings.

## Architecture
- **Wazuh Manager** (Ubuntu VM)
- **Wazuh Dashboard / Kibana**
- **Data Sources**:
  - SSH authentication logs
  - File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
  - Malware detection (via YARA/VirusTotal integration)
  - MITRE ATT&CK mappings

## Steps Taken
1. **Installed prebuilt dashboards** from Wazuh (Security Information, Malware Detection, Threat Detection & Response).
2. **Created custom dashboards** to monitor:
   - Failed SSH login attempts
   - File changes in sensitive directories
   - Malware detection events
   - MITRE ATT&CK stages (Persistence, Privilege Escalation, etc.)
3. **Generated test events** to validate dashboards:
   - Simulated SSH brute force attempts
   - Modified `/etc/passwd` for FIM detection
   - Ran EICAR test malware file for malware alert
4. **Configured filters and timelines**:
   - `rule.groups: authentication_failed` → SSH brute-force monitoring
   - `rule.groups: ossec` → FIM changes
   - `rule.level >= 7` → High-severity alerts
5. **Created analyst reports**:
   - Captured trends (spikes in failed logins, malware alerts)
   - Highlighted correlations (same IP for brute force and file changes)
   - Documented findings with screenshots and narrative summary

## Example Threat Hunting Scenarios
- **SSH Brute Force → Privilege Escalation**
  - Filtered by multiple `authentication_failed` events from a single IP.
  - Correlated with a successful login followed by `sudo` use.
- **Malware Alert → MITRE Tactic**
  - EICAR file triggered a malware alert.
  - Mapped to MITRE ATT&CK `Execution` tactic.
- **File Integrity Changes**
  - Unauthorized modification to `/etc/passwd` file detected.
  - Escalated as a potential persistence technique.

- MITRE ATT&CK tactic alignment
- Example report with trends and correlations

## Skills Demonstrated
- SIEM dashboard customization
- Threat hunting using log correlation
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping for SOC workflows
- SOC reporting: summarizing threats, documenting impact, and providing remediation context
