# Project 6 – Automated Threat Denial with Wazuh

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I implemented **automated threat denial** in my personal SOC lab using **Wazuh SIEM**.  
The goal was to simulate a **real-world SOC response** where the SIEM not only detects malicious activity (e.g., brute-force SSH attempts) but also **blocks the threat automatically** using active response scripts.

This demonstrates **incident detection + automated remediation**, a key SOC analyst skill.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- **Wazuh Manager** deployed on Ubuntu
- **Wazuh Agent** running on a monitored endpoint (Ubuntu/Mac)
- Access to `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` for configuration
- Test environment for generating SSH brute-force attempts (using `hydra` or manual failed login attempts)

---

## 🚀 Steps Taken

### 1. Enable Active Response in Wazuh
Edited the **ossec.conf** file on the Wazuh Manager:
```xml
<ossec_config>
  <active-response>
    <disabled>no</disabled>
    <ca_store>/var/ossec/etc/sslmanager.cert</ca_store>
  </active-response>
</ossec_config>
