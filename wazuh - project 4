# Project 4: MITRE ATT&CK Mapping & Threat Simulation with Wazuh

This project demonstrates how to **simulate adversary behaviors** on an Ubuntu server, generate **Wazuh alerts**, and map them to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**. 
The goal is to showcase threat detection, analysis, and reporting skills relevant for SOC analyst roles.

## üöÄ Project Overview
- **Tooling**: Wazuh SIEM, Ubuntu agent, Wazuh dashboard
- **Focus**: Threat simulation, alert generation, MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- **SOC Relevance**: Demonstrates ability to connect logs ‚Üí attacker behavior ‚Üí defensive actions

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Taken

### 1. Simulated Adversary Behavior on Ubuntu
Executed commands to mimic real attacker actions:

- **Brute Force SSH (T1110 ‚Äì Credential Access)**  
  ```bash
  ssh invaliduser@localhost
  ssh invaliduser@localhost
  ssh invaliduser@localhost

Screenchots
- Generating test events
- Investigating alerts
- Mapping to ATT&CK framework
- Writing actionable reports
